		<h1> Spot's Fan Page</h1>
		<p> My dog Spot is the best dog. He is more extroverted than I am, and always goes up to strangers when we are on a walk. But when we are at home he just likes to lay in the blankets next to me on the couch. </p>
		<p> Spot's favorite things are</p>
			<ol>
			<li>tennis balls</li>
			<li>food</li>
			<li>nap time</li>
		<p> After I finish my studies, he will go also back to school so he can pass a Canine Good Citizenship Test and then children can practice reading to him. People Animal Love (PAL) is one organization that arranges reading time to dogs. </p>
